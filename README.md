# ShoppingCart

It is a shopping cart project in which I worked on the Customer login 
part as mentioned below.
Customer user features:  
● View all available products in store inventory  
● Add product to cart.  
● Remove product from cart.  
● Empty cart (remove all products).  
● Change product quantities in cart.  
● Check out (purchase all products in cart).  
● Log out
